            Originally from California, traveled the world and now back in the
            States. Having grown up in Silicon Valley I was always intrigued by
            technology but never brave enough to fully explore that field. Now
            having completed a fullstack MERN web development boot camp at
            George Washington University, I wish I had started a long time ago.

            I Remember my first computer a Windows '99 machine that ran on
            dial-up. Playing video games on that old thing was like watching a
            PowerPoint presentation. In middle school, our computers got viruses
            because we were using Internet Explorer. I now know that IE
            connected the internet to the user's file system which is a glaring
            security issue, but when I was a kid I wondered why. These early
            interactions with computers sparked my interest in learning more
            about them. Why is my computer so slow? How did all of these
            malicious viruses get there? It wasn't until my early twenties when
            I recognized this passion for tech that I started to explore this
            newly discovered love.
          </p>
          <p>
            After much consideration and self study, I eventually applied to
            attend a coding boot camp in hopes of chasing my dream. Since
            attending George Washington's Fullstack Web Developer Coding
            Bootcamp, I have fallen in love with programming. There are so many
            possibilities and different solutions to the same problem; this
            fascinates me and I continue to grow as a developer everyday as well
            as my yearning to know more. I have truly found my passion.
